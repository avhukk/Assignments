    "* **`'b'`**: Binary mode. (Images)\n",

    "* **`'w'`** : Write mode. Using the model will overwrite anyexisting file content. If file does not exist, a new one will be created. \n",
    "* **`'r+'`** : Read and Write mode: This mode will help in reading and writing simultaneously. \n",
    "* **`'a'`** : Append mode : This mode will help in appending data without overwriting any data existing in the file. \n",
    "* **`'a+'`** : Append and Read mode : This mode one can read and append the data without overwriting the original file. \n",
    "* **`'x'`** : Exclusive creating mode : To be used when the sole purpose is the create neuw files if the file in question does not exist beforehand. "

Whereas the `readline()` reads one line at a time. If the first sentence of the file is 2 lines long, then the function would parse the content corresponding only to 1 line. "
